all. It allows to interrogate SIMBAD with the Astronomical Data Query Language
(ADQL) and allows a direct access to all the tables that SIMBAD contains.

.. glossary::

    ADQL
        Astronomical Data Query Language. This is a flavor of the Structured
        Query Language (SQL) adapted to astronomy. To learn more about this
        language, see the `ADQL documentation <https://ivoa.net/documents/ADQL/index.html>`__
        or the `Simbad ADQL cheat sheet <http://simbad.cds.unistra.fr/simbad/tap/help/adqlHelp.html>`__.

    relational database
        a database made of a collection of tables with connections between them.
        To link tables, use the JOIN directives of the ADQL. See
        `graphic representation of Simbad's tables and their relations
        <http://simbad.cds.unistra.fr/simbad/tap/tapsearch.html>`__.
        
    TAP
        Table Access Protocol. This describes the way tables can be accessed with
        the ADQL.
